# Factions - A Plugin For Spigot

### See something I did that's either inefficient or problematic? Don't hestiate to let me know, I'll be happy to fix it.
I am a former PocketMine developer, a server software for the bedrock edition of Minecraft written in PHP, so I'm a bit... *noobish* when it comes to using Spigot's API, and some aspects of Java in general. However, that won't stop me from pushing updates here and there.

### This is PUBLIC CODE, meaning I DO NOT CARE who uses it...
*as long as you give credit where credit is due.*
